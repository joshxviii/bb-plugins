To use this plugin, first open the Model Project that you would like to render another model on. This Project has to be a bedrock entity model and should have some Locator(s). After that you can select from any other open Model Project. The selected Model will render on a selected Locator.

This plugin was made for Cobblemon models, but should work with other bedrock entity models.
